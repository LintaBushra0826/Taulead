It is my final year project. Below is the description of my project:
The system enables manufacturers to efficiently manage their operations through comprehensive modules for user account management, raw material inventory, human resources, process planning, and execution. Key features include secure user registration and authentication, customizable raw material and unit management, employee record handling, and robust process execution with real-time monitoring and reporting capabilities.

User Account Management: Facilitates secure registration and login, enabling manufacturers to manage profiles and receive confirmation notifications.

Raw Material Management: Allows creation and tracking of custom measuring units, raw material entries, and price logs, with functionalities for updates, deletions, and inventory reviews.

Human Resources Inventory: Supports the creation and management of employee records, including role-specific details and termination logs.

Process Planning and Execution: Enables the creation and monitoring of processes and subprocesses, with resource allocation, inventory tracking, and real-time progress updates. It includes comprehensive logging and reporting features for process optimization.
